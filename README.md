# sample_code

Repository of some sample code. 
Includes Fortran, python and R code. 

# File Description

genetic_algorithm.py, parallel.py and model_definition_module.f90 form the basis of my PhD work on GADRAD (see here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00120.pdf) in which I implemented a genetic algorithm to optimise a radiative transfer simulation solution of a stellar astrophysical environment. 

qi_functions.r are some of the R functions that I use to speed up my current workflow. Further descriptions can be found in the files.
